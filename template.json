  "template": "Write a very short, romantic rhyme to appreciate Huda using the word '{word}'. Express admiration for her beauty, kindness, or presence. Keep it simple, natural, and poetic. You may add a touch of Urdu if it makes the rhyme sound more heartfelt. You may also softly include Shia expressions in a romantic and respectful way, but only if they flow naturally. Make sure Urdu and Shia words appear normally (without italics)."
