  "template": "Write a very short, romantic rhyme for Huda using the word '{word}'. Keep it simple, natural, and poetic. You may add a touch of Urdu if it makes the rhyme sound more beautiful. You may also softly include Shia expressions such as Ya Ali (Ø¹), Noor, Dua, Sajda, Iman, or Ahlebayt, but keep them romantic and respectful. Make sure Urdu and Shia words appear normally (without italics)."
